This passage critically examines the historical impact of motor vehicles on health and the environment, emphasizing road traffic injuries, air pollution, physical inactivity, noise pollution, social issues, and climate change. The author questions the prevailing belief that electric cars (ECs) provide a comprehensive solution to these problems, delving into both their potential advantages and drawbacks.

The narrative underscores the adverse health effects linked to escalated car usage, particularly the disproportionate impact of road traffic injuries on young individuals and the contribution to air pollution. The central argument posits that the transition to ECs alone may not effectively address these concerns unless accompanied by the implementation of altered speed limits and systemic changes.

The text underscores the significance of establishing safer systems, advocating for safer speeds, and integrating urban planning strategies to reduce road traffic injuries. It raises doubts about the efficacy of ECs in achieving the requisite 50-80% reduction in air pollution, taking into account non-exhaust emissions and the origin of electricity powering ECs.

Furthermore, the discussion explores the ramifications of car-related factors on physical inactivity, obesity, and societal inequalities, contending that both internal combustion engine cars (ICE-Cs) and ECs contribute to these issues. Interrogations are posed regarding whether a shift to ECs would motivate more children to actively commute to school, and apprehensions are expressed about potential disparities in EC adoption.

The discourse extends to noise pollution, community severance, and social cohesion, arguing that busy roads negatively impact health and local businesses. The text suggests that ECs might not necessarily outperform ICE-Cs in reducing noise pollution effectively.

The passage concludes by challenging the assumption that ECs are a universal solution, advocating for a heightened focus on developing efficient public transport systems and instigating behavioral shifts to address the substantial health downsides linked with car usage. Additionally, concerns are raised about the influence of motor vehicle manufacturers on government policies, drawing parallels with the historical influence of cigarette manufacturers.
