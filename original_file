Introduction
When Henry Ford created a motor vehicle for the masses in the early 1900s he revolutionized transportation. He also created an unparalleled epidemic of injury and ill health that we have still not yet fully recognized. In the 12 000 year existence of roads, the advantages and disadvantages have remained consistent; facilitating trade, development and communication, but also spreading illness and disease. The past 120 years have magnified the disbenefits, including road traffic injury, air pollution, noise pollution, physical inactivity, social isolation, community severance and loneliness, to an almost incomprehensible extent.

For much of the 20th century, governments across the developed world have encouraged, supported and subsidized the personal motor car market, and necessary oil industry, and built the roads needed for it. Roads have become ever wider, currently peaking at 26 lanes on the Katy Freeway, Houston, TX,1 but personal motor car building has outpaced road building to the extent that congestion, once known as ‘rush hour’, has led to 10 day ‘traffic jams’.2 However, as has long been clear, road building as a ‘response’ to congestion merely creates more traffic,3 increasing road use by up to 8–10% per year.4

In recent years, it has become apparent to policy makers across the globe that change is needed. The supply of oil, needed to fuel internal combustion engines (ICE), is finite, and clean air advocates, such as ClientEarth, have taken governments, including the UK and Welsh Government,5,6 to task over a failure to tackle air quality problems. To date, 11 countries and 7 territories have announced bans on the sale of new petrol and/or diesel engine vehicles,7 including a UK wide ban by 2040. Governments are now promoting the development of electric cars (ECs), and the associated infrastructure, to fill the gap.8

However, when we consider what was achieved before mass motor car use and the disbenefits, particularly to health, which have resulted from it, before accepting ECs as ‘the answer’ it is important to compare the health ‘benefits’ of ECs with ICE cars (ICE-C).

How do we reduce car-related road traffic injuries?
Bridget Driscoll was not the first car-related road traffic crash (RTC) fatality in the world, but what was notable about her death was that the coroner conducting her inquest concluded that he hoped ‘such a thing would never happen again’.9 By 2010, RoSPA estimated that 550 000 people had died as a result of motor vehicle crashes on UK roads.9

Overwhelmingly, the burden of RTC deaths and injuries falls on young people; road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the leading cause of death amongst 15–29-year olds and, on average, cost Governments 3% of GDP.10 Currently, RTIs are the ninth leading cause of death in all age groups, but are expected to rise to seventh by 2030.10

In the UK in 2016, there were 1792 road traffic deaths, 24 101 serious injuries and 181 384 casualties.11 The deaths were a 4% increase on 2015, but 44% lower than in 2006 when 3172 died on UK roads. However, these data are based on police reported RTCs, rather than the actual health effects of these crashes. Pedestrian and cyclist crashes are believed to be under-reported to the police12 and there is far from complete overlap between the official numbers of RTIs, based on police data, and the numbers treated in the NHS.13–15

Road danger reduction aims to address the real and perceived dangers of motor vehicles, changing the historical emphasis on vulnerable road users having to take responsibility for their own safety.16–18 Achieving this needs the creation of safer systems; the WHO recommended approach.10 Safe systems mean that death and serious injury are not accepted as the price of mobility and although collisions occur, deaths and injuries are preventable. There is an acceptance that people make mistakes but the aim is to ensure that these mistakes do not lead to deaths or serious injuries.19,20

Within these safer systems, safer speeds,21 particularly in urban areas, are important for reducing crash risk. Urban, residential area maximum speeds of 20mph, or 30kph, are increasingly being advocated for10 and implemented as the realization increases that not only does higher speed increase the risk of crashing, but that it also increases the severity of injury when a crash does occur.22,23 Higher vehicle speeds are also suggested to contribute to many of the negative factors associated with cars, namely noise and air pollution, community severance and personal isolation and loneliness, as well as physical inactivity, as parents drive their children places to avoid the ‘dangers’ of speeding vehicles when walking.24–26

Safer systems and safer speeds are intended to achieve Vision Zero. Vision Zero began in Sweden in 1997 and by 2020 aims to create a road traffic system on which no deaths or serious injuries occur.27 Following this, between 2000 and 2010 the number of road deaths in Sweden halved, with the number of car user deaths dropping by 60%, but since then there has been little overall change.28 However, the Vision Zero ethos is still seen as positive and has now been adopted in places such as Canada, New York City, London, Bogota. The EU has set it’s Vision Zero target at 2050.29

However, there are wider factors, such as planning policy and practice, which can also contribute to reductions in RTCs. Currently, transport planning and land use planning are not well integrated.30 Urban form affects road safety by influencing mode and route choice; ‘Urban sprawl’ increases journey time to work, school and recreation and generally forces people to make these journeys by car.31,32 This increases road traffic injury risk for all road users.33 Air quality issues will be dealt with in a later section, but it should also be noted that urban planning measures are seen as having greatest potential for bringing about air quality gains, as well as improved physical activity and reduced obesity.30,34,35 At the simplest level, ensuring that there are clear lines of sight, appropriate parking restrictions, reduced road widths to support pedestrian crossing and improved junction designs, and engineering to reduce vehicle speeds can all help to reduce crash risk.32,36

Will a shift to ECs address the RTI problem? It seems unlikely that they can do so unless their use is accompanied by system changes such as a reduction in speed limits. Governments across the world are reluctant to regulate vehicle speeds more robustly because the dominant paradigm is that travelling quickly promotes economic growth and until these are decoupled, there is little hope of further gain in terms of healthier streets.19 Ultimately, an EC travelling at 30 mph does not offer anything different in terms of road traffic injury risk than an ICE-C travelling at 30 mph, it just further enforces the speed and economic growth notion. However, recent evidence suggests the greater weight of ECs may actually mean that the risks of injury associated with them are increased; stopping distances will be longer and the damage inflicted in a collision will be greater.30

How do we reduce car-related air pollution?
Air quality is currently, arguably, one of the most pressing political public health issues. The UK Government and Welsh Government have been forced to review plans for cutting air pollution levels following legal action by ClientEarth, an environmental law NGO. In both cases, the failure to produce a plan to reduce air pollution levels to within legal limits was found to be unlawful and the Welsh Government ordered to produce a plan by July 31, 2018, the UK Government by October 5, 2018.5

Whatever form these plans take, road traffic is a leading cause of air pollution,37 producing carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including benzene, and in the presence of sunlight, the NOx and VOCs react to form the secondary pollutant ozone.38 Overall, transport has been estimated to contribute 20–30% of air pollution emissions,39 including around 44% of all CO emissions, 33% of NOx emissions, 21% of airborne particulates and 12% of VOCs.38

To achieve health based nitrogen dioxide (NO2) targets, it has been suggested that reductions in road transport emissions of at least 50%, but up to 75–80% will be needed.37 Currently, diesel cars are the second largest source of NO2 behind HGVs and buses, and they are also the leading source of PM emissions.37 But, PM results from brake and tyre wear, as well as road erosion, meaning that the contribution of petrol vehicles to PM production is also substantial.

The health effects of air pollution are mainly associated with NO2 and PM; PM, particularly PM2.5, has the greatest health effects, estimated at 29 000 attributable deaths per year, but those linked to NO2 are also substantial, at 23 500 attributable deaths per year.40 Accounting for the overlap between the two pollutants, the overall figure is estimated at 44 750 attributable deaths, usually from increases in, or exacerbations of, respiratory or heart disease.40 In comparison, the effect of smoking is estimated at 78 000 attributable deaths, while in 2015, RTCs caused 1732 deaths in the UK.40 The critical difference is that while air pollution related deaths and ill health tend to be among older people, the RTC deaths are mainly among teenagers and young adults.

So by switching to an all-electric car fleet, will the required 50–80% reductions in air pollution be realized? While NO2 emissions are reduced to zero in an electric fleet, 90% of PM10 and 85% of PM2.5 come from non-exhaust emissions; so brake, tyre and road wear.41 In addition, although ECs use regenerative braking, which reverses motors to help slow the car, because they are 24% heavier than equivalent ICE-Cs, PM production shows little overall change.41 PM10 production of an EC was found to be the same as in an ICE-C equivalent while PM2.5 emissions were 1–3% lower.41 Therefore, a switch to ECs may not reduce overall PM emissions

In addition, the power source for electricity for ECs may still create emissions, particularly if generated in coal fired power stations. What changes is that while ICE-Cs pollute near the ground where they are being driven, ECs pollute where the power is being generated, at whatever height the power station discharges.42–44 Obviously, with a switch to cleaner, greener methods of producing power, this becomes less of problem. It also means that for any given EC at any given point in time, EC power being generated could be very clean, for example, if generated with wind power, but it could be very dirty, if coming from coal power.42–44 Estimates have also suggested that if 90% of the current UK ICE-C fleet is switched to EC, an additional 18 GW of electricity would be required.45 The new nuclear power station being developed at Hinckley Point will generate 3.2 GW.46 In addition, in some areas, the grid is already struggling to power existing and planned developments;46 how it will accommodate the demands of a switch to ECs is not clear. Issues with the lack of progress in decarbonizing electricity production has been highlighted as limiting the prospects of potential emission, climate and air quality benefits of electric cars.47

How do we reverse car-related physical inactivity and reduce obesity?
With increased personal car use has come a decrease in travel related physical activity, including that associated with moving to public transport stops. The health problems associated with physical inactivity include increased risk of type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancers, depression, osteoporosis and anxiety.48 WHO have estimated that physical inactivity causes 30% of ischaemic heart disease, 21–25% of breast and colon cancers and 27% of diabetes.49 Physically active adults have a 20–30% reduced risk of premature death.50

Encouraging a substantial shift in regular travel mode from motorized individual transport to active travel is the goal of many countries across the world.19 This will not only increase physical activity and decrease obesity, and reduce respiratory diseases, three key health goals, but will also benefit the societal goals of reducing air pollution and transport related global climate change.19

Both ICE-C and ECs are motorized private transport; there is unlikely to be a physical activity gain with a switch from ICE-C to ECs.

How do we increase numbers of children who ‘active travel’ to school?
Travelling to school alone was historically a mark of independence, but as parents become increasingly concerned about road traffic danger,51,52 the proportions who travel to school by car have increased from 16% in 1985/87 to 32% in 200 653 and the age at which unescorted travel is permitted has increased.54

Children who live on busier streets are less likely to be allowed to play in the streets, which is bad for mental and physical development. Children have more restrictions on their play and independent mobility than previously,26,54,55 leading to falling levels of physical activity and fitness and increased obesity levels.56

Recent data for Wales suggest that 43% of primary school pupils walk or cycle to school, while 35% of secondary school pupils walk or cycle.57 It is Welsh Government policy to encourage more children to travel to and from school using active modes; the Active Journeys programme and Walk to School toolkit all aim to support and encourage this.58 While this is an important policy, it focuses on changing behaviours without linking them to the consistently evidence based reasons why parents are reluctant to allow children to use active travel and / or travel alone, namely traffic volumes and speeds.

Will a switch to ECs help governments to achieve their active travel to school targets? It seems unlikely that this will be the case. To a parent making a decision about school travel, a vehicle presents a danger whether it is an ICE-C or is an EC.

How do we reduce motor car-related noise pollution?
There are two main sources of noise related to ICE-C; noise from the vehicle itself, so for example, engine and transmission noise, and noise created by the tyres on the road. Technological and manufacturing advances have, in recent years, lead to substantial decreases in vehicle noise of ICE-Cs.59 In terms of tyre: road noise, substantial increases only occur at speeds of >55 kph.59

Reductions in noise pollution are important and needed because of the negative health effects associated with noise, including stress and anxiety, hypertension and sleep loss.60–64 People already suffering with physical or mental health problems are most sensitive to traffic noise.65 The burden of disease attributable to traffic related noise is comparable to that of air pollution.66

Noise pollution can be designed out, either with quieter road surfaces that reduce noise by 4-8 decibels, a change that is equivalent to halving traffic volumes,59 or, on some roads, usually motorways, with the use of ‘walls’ to create a noise barrier.67 Of course, the suitable roads make up a very small proportion of the full road network and the numbers of people living very close to these is small.

Although ECs have historically been considerably quieter than ICE-C, because of lower engine and transmission noise, the tyre: road interface still exists. As ICE-C have become quieter, the gap between the two has narrowed.

Therefore achieving future significant reductions in road noise is important and will need changes at the tyre: road interface. This could be achieved for all vehicles with reductions in speed limits, but it is difficult to see how ECs will achieve this more rapidly or effectively than ICE-C. In addition, ECs are considerably heavier than their motor equivalents, in the order of 24%.41 Therefore, at similar speeds, and with similar engine noise, tyre: road noise from an EC may be greater than an equivalent ICE-C.

How do we reduce car-related inequalities?
That RTCs and air pollution effects disproportionately affect those in the most deprived communities is well known.68,69 Efforts to reduce these inequalities have, as yet, had limited success. Traffic calming has been shown to reduce child pedestrian injury inequalities,70 but the unintended consequence is likely to have been increases in air pollution because of the braking and acceleration associated with speed humps.36,71

But, not only are the consequences of car use unequally distributed, car ownership is too. In Wales, there is a lack of current detail on car ownership by socio economic group. In 2011, 13% of home owners in Wales did not own a car or van, compared with 53% of those renting socially and 35% of those with private rentals.72 It seems unlikely that there have been substantial changes in these proportions since then.

More recently though, in Wales, the IWA46 found that the relative lack of prosperity will be a hindrance to significant change to ECs and that there is a risk of a charging network developing only where there are people wealthy enough to purchase ECs. In addition, IWA46 also raised concerns that the charging infrastructure could obstruct walkers and cyclists, meaning that those without ECs face a double negative effect in that not only do they not have access to ECs, but the use of ECs by others compromises their ability to travel freely. Another perspective on this would be that the least deprived have most access to cars and to fuel and maintain them, thereby meaning that they also have the greatest negative effect on health and the environment.

This means that a focus on ECs for transportation could lead to inequalities at the individual and societal level growing.

How do we reduce community severance and improve social cohesion damaged by motor car use?
Busy roads are known to affect health by separating local residents from goods, services or other people, an effect that may be known as community severance,24 an issue that can cause significant damage physical and mental health.26 The seminal work on this subject was a study in San Francisco that found that numbers of friends and acquaintances reported by residents of three parallel streets was inversely proportional to traffic volume.60 Where traffic was lighter, residents had a greater sense of community and togetherness.

But, the effects go beyond just that ‘sense’ because social network quality has been found to be linked to poor health,73–85 mortality86–97 and negative health behaviours,98–101 whether the social network is defined as close relationships with friends, acquaintances, relatives or neighbours,74,88,96 extent and diversity of social contacts with friends, neighbours and family outside the home76 or a wide range of other markers. As in many other areas of health, those who are most susceptible to these effects are those who are young, old or have disabilities and their response is usually either to use cars themselves or to stay at home,24 therefore exacerbating the problem.

But not only do busy roads affect social networks, they also have implications for the viability of local businesses. People who walk, cycle or travel by bus to local shops do so more regularly than those who travel by car and as a result spend more overall.102,103

A recent study in Wales has found that 17–23% of people report being lonely and the dispersion of social and support networks and the severance associated with increased car use was highlighted by a Director of Public Health as a major contributor to this.104 Again, it is difficult to see how the promotion of ECs will have any significant effect other than to perpetuate these issues.

How do we mitigate the effects of climate change?
Transport accounted for 23% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 and, even with improvements in vehicle efficiency, is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.105 In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted the importance of mitigating the effects of private vehicles with improved fuels, including biofuels, to reduce levels of fine particulates, other traffic related pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions.106 ECs are a part of this technological revolution.

However, such technology heavy solutions are not necessarily good for health or health equity,107 not least because there are few, if any, additional benefits for traffic injuries, noise or physical activity that cannot result from shifting from private cars to efficient public and non-motorized transport.107 Furthermore, encouraging EC use is only likely to increase car use and this will soon offset the technological benefits.108 In a recent article, the IWA state that ECs could make an important contribution to decarbonization but emphasize the fact that they are not a panacea.46

How do we achieve low carbon transport in rural areas?
In rural areas, public transport is poor and significant improvements, particularly for the sparsely populated areas of mid and West Wales and other similar areas, are unlikely.46 Rural communities have less congestion and pollution, therefore benefitting health, but the disbenefits include lower levels of physical activity because of increased car use and greater risks of social exclusion.67

In this case, ECs may offer the best low carbon alternative. However, given that people in rural areas have, historically, been known to maintain older vehicles for longer because of the greater costs of travel because of the distances involved in doing so, switching to ECs is likely to, in effect, represent a greater cost than to those in urban areas. People in rural areas also need to be able to make such a switch with the confidence that they will be able to make long distance journeys.

In addition, one of the reasons why people in rural areas have maintained vehicles for longer is the poor provision of public transport in these areas. Aiming to increase rural EC infrastructure is likely to be met with even greater challenges than increasing public transport.

What if we electrify public transport?
This review has focused mainly upon electrification of the car fleet and the detrimental effects that this may have on health because it maintains the personal car status quo. Modal shift to active travel and public transport is essential to making significant improvements in transport related health issues. However, it is also important to consider the potential impacts of increasing public transport use, how it should be powered and sustainability.

A detailed review of this is beyond the scope of this paper, but, generally, the electrification of public transport, in particular electric buses and taxis, is believed to have a higher positive impact than personal car electrification.109,110 There is evidence to suggest that electric city buses could substantially decrease emissions and improve air quality,111–113 leading to the mayors of 12 major world cities, including London, Paris and Los Angeles, pledging to buy only all-electric buses from 2025.114 However, it has also been suggested that the challenges to the grid of electric buses are still significant, particularly in the cases where battery capacity is being increased to more than 350 kWh.115–116

Conclusions
The growth in car use is unsustainable from a health perspective and significant change is needed. However, there is little evidence to suggest that EVs can offer the universal solution that global governments are seeking. Yes, there are benefits of continuing to develop EVs in terms of the direct and indirect contributions to employment, but these efforts may be better directed at creating more efficient public transport systems, rather than supporting personal transportation, if the significant health disbenefits of car use during the past 150 years are to be in any way reduced.

Climate change science suggests that limiting environmental warming to 1.5°C is theoretically possible but requires significant changes in human behaviours, including in the way that we travel.117 The promotion of ECs and associated technology as ‘the answer’ may merely reflect the influence of motor vehicle manufacturers on government policy, rather than health scientists, in much the same way as cigarette manufacturers have.
